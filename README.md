## Bird Component

The Bird component (`src/components/Bird.tsx`) is a key feature of the application that:

- Displays a bird logo that smoothly transitions between black and white variants
- Uses CSS transitions for smooth opacity changes
- Automatically changes variants at random intervals (1-6 seconds)
- Implements React's hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for state management
- Utilizes Next.js Image component for optimized image loading

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build`: Creates a production build
- `npm run start`: Runs the production server
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks

## Configuration

The project includes several configuration files:

- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint rules
